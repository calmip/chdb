== Initialization ==
Master --> Master: Init mpi
Master --> md: Read the list of files to treat

== Barrier (waiting for init) ==

== Processing ==
loop until all slaves running
	Master -> s1bs: Sending block of files (CHDB_TAG_GO)
	loop for files in block
		s1bs --> s1d: Reading file
		s1d --> s1bs: file read
		s1bs --> s1bs: Executing program
		Note over s1bs,s1d: Asynchronous execution
	end loop
	Master -> s2bs: sending block of files (CHDB_TAG_GO)
	loop for files in block
		s2bs --> s2d: Reading file
		s2d --> s2bs: file read
		s2bs --> s2bs: Executing program
		Note over s2bs,s2d: Asynchronous execution
	end loop
end

loop until no more blocks
	s2bs -> Master: sending results (CHDB_TAG_READY)
	Note over s1bs, s2d
	   The slave is given a new block
	   as soon as finished current
	end note
	Master -> s2bs: Sending block of files
	loop for files in block
		s2bs --> s2d: Reading file
		s2d --> s2bs: file read
		s2bs --> s2bs: Executing program
		Note over s2bs,s2d: Asynchronous execution
	end loop

	s2bs -> Master: sending results (CHDB_TAG_READY)
	s1bs -> Master: sending results (CHDB_TAG_READY)
	Master -> s1bs: Sending block of files (CHDB_TAG_GO)
	loop for files in block
		s1bs --> s1d: Reading file
		s1d --> s1bs: file read
		s1bs --> s1bs: Executing program
		Note over s1bs,s1d: Asynchronous execution
	end loop
	Note over Master,s2d
	   Processing order is unpredictable
	end note
end

== Terminating ==
loop until all slaves finished
	Master -> s2bs: Close everything (CHDB_TAG_END)
    s2bs --> s2d: Copying data from tmp or memory
    s2d --> s2bs: Done
    s2bs -> Master: finished (CHDB_TAG_END)
    Master --> md: Consolidating slave2 data to Output Dir
    md --> Master: OK
	Master -> s1bs: Close everything (CHDB_TAG_END)
    s1bs --> s1d: Copying data from tmp or memory
    s1d --> s1bs: Done
    s1bs -> Master: finished (CHDB_TAG_END)
    Master --> md: Consolidating slave1 data to Output Dir
    md --> Master: OK
