INSTALLING chdb:
================

1/ Prerequisites:
=================
You should have a c++ compiler (gcc rel >=5.4.0), AND an mpi implementation (chdb compiles with openmpi AND with intelmpi)

2/ Compiling:
=============
make

3/ Installing:
==============
Have a look to the install.sh script as you should probably have to change some things.
The script tries to copy requested files to their destination: the binaries, some wrappers AND a module file. This is very
useful if you use the Module gnu command (see http://modules.sourceforge.net/) on your site.
