INSTALLING chdb:
================

1/ Prerequisites:
-----------------
You should have a c++ compiler (gcc rel >=5.4.0), AND an mpi implementation: chdb may be used with:
    - Any mpi implementation if you do not use mpi-based slaves
    - openmpi OR intelmpi if want to use chdb with mpi-based slaves

2/ Installing:
--------------
`cmake -S. -Bbuild [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/chdb/installation]`

### Selecting the correct mpi library:

If the current mpi release cannot be detected, you may force an mpi type with:

`cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCHDB_MPI=OPENMPI|INTELMPI  [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/chdb/installation]`

Only intelmpi or openmpi are currently supported

### Selecting the correct c++ standard level:

The default is using C++20, however only several 2020 or 2017 specific lines are provided, they are indicated during the compilation and an alternated code is proposed for older compilers.

If you compiler does not support C++20 std, you may select 2014 or 2017 with:

`cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14|17 [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/chdb/installation]`

chdb compiles at least with gcc 4.8.5 to 10.3.0

### Compiling

Then build the software:

`cd build`
`make`
`make install`

3/ Testing:
-----------
### Functional tests:

1. You can try the tests in directory `ftests`
2. You can follow the chdb tutorial available on https://www.calmip.univ-toulouse.fr/spip.php?article648
   (The "Essential" part of the tuto should work)

### Unit tests (for developers):

Install first the testing framework googletest:

`git clone https://github.com/google/googletest`
`cd googletest`
`GOOGLETEST_ROOT=$(pwd)`
`mkdir build`
`cd build`
`cmake  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${GOOGLETEST_ROOT} ..`
`make install`

then from the chdb directory:

`cd chdb`
`cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DGOOGLETEST_ROOT=${GOOGLETEST_ROOT}`
`cd build`
`make`
`./parameters_unittest`
`./system_unittest`
`./directories_unittest`
`./scheduler_unittest`

**NOTE** - This was tested with googletest release 1.12.1
